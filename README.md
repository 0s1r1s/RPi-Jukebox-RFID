## Shopping list

Here is a list of equipment needed. Chances are that you will find most of it in the back of your drawers or at the bottom of some shoe box. Well, most of it, possibly not the RFID reader itself.

* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B ](http://amzn.to/2ku0PU7) | You might be surprised how easy and affordable you can get an RPi second hand. Think about the planet before you buy a new one.
* [Contactless RFID IC Card Reader with USB Interface PLUS 5 Cards + 5 Key Fob](http://amzn.to/2kXkMjr) | This package is good value for money, because it gets you started, including everything plus 5 RFID cards and 5 key fobs. 
* [USB Stereo Speaker Set (6 Watt, 3,5mm jack, USB-powered) black](http://amzn.to/2kXrard) | This USB powered speaker set sounds good for its size, is good value for money and keeps this RPi project clean and without the need of a soldering iron :)
* [External USB Soundcard with Virtual Surround Sound, Plug & Play](http://amzn.to/2kXflBf) | The additional soundcard is optional. If you don't like the sound coming straight from the RPi jack, this is a good value for money USB soundcard.
* [USB A Male to Female Extenstion Cable with Switch On/Off](http://amzn.to/2kXflBf) | I placed this USB extension between the USB power adapter and the jukebox. This will allow you to switch the jukebox on and off easily.
* [USB 2.0 Hub 4-port bus powered USB Adapter](http://amzn.to/2kXeErv) | Depending on your setup, you will need none, one or two of these. If you are using the external USB powered speakers, you need one to make sure the speakers get enough power. If you want to use the additional USB soundcard and have an older RPi, you might need a second one to make sure you can connect enough devices with the RPi.
