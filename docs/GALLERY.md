# Jukebox Gallery
Because everybody is an individual - and so are their jukeboxes - I started this gallery. If you want to be part of it, either create a pull request or post your image to the [Pics of my jukebox](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/5) thread. I will copy them to the gallery.

| Cramped space for a RPi3 a 3 Watt amp and power bank... | ... all wrapped in Markus' portable vintage radio.  |
